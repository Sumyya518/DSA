# 📘 BUBBLE SORT – THEORY (DSA)
# ==========================================

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 WHAT IS BUBBLE SORT?
# ------------------------------------------
# Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array
# in ascending order by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements
# and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
#
# The largest values gradually "bubble up" to the end of the array,
# which is how the algorithm got its name.

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 HOW BUBBLE SORT WORKS
# ------------------------------------------
# 1. Start from the first element of the array.
# 2. Compare it with the next element.
# 3. If the first element is greater than the next one, swap them.
# 4. Move one step forward and repeat the comparison.
# 5. After one full pass, the largest element reaches the end.
# 6. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion.
# 7. Continue until the array becomes fully sorted.

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 WHY IT IS CALLED "BUBBLE" SORT
# ------------------------------------------
# The largest values move step by step to the end of the array,
# similar to how bubbles rise to the surface of water.

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 NUMBER OF PASSES
# ------------------------------------------
# For an array of size n:
# - The first pass places the largest element at the end.
# - The second pass places the second-largest element.
# - This continues until the smallest element reaches the start.
# - Total passes required = n - 1

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 TIME COMPLEXITY OF BUBBLE SORT
# ------------------------------------------
# Best Case    → O(n)
#   - When the array is already sorted and we use an optimization
#     that stops the algorithm if no swaps occur in a pass.
#
# Average Case → O(n²)
#   - When elements are in random order.
#
# Worst Case   → O(n²)
#   - When the array is sorted in reverse order.
#
# Reason:
# - Bubble Sort uses two nested loops.
# - Each element is compared with others multiple times.
# - Total comparisons ≈ n × n = n².

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 SPACE COMPLEXITY OF BUBBLE SORT
# ------------------------------------------
# Space Complexity → O(1) (Constant space)
#
# Reason:
# - Bubble Sort sorts the array in-place.
# - It does not create a new array.
# - Only a few temporary variables are used for swapping.
# - Extra memory does NOT grow with input size.

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 WHY SPACE COMPLEXITY IS NOT O(n)
# ------------------------------------------
# Space complexity becomes O(n) only when:
# - A new array or data structure of size n is created.
#
# Bubble Sort does NOT create any new array.
# Therefore, extra memory remains constant → O(1).

# ------------------------------------------
# 📌 WHY WE FOCUS ON WORST-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY
# ------------------------------------------
# Although algorithms have best, average, and worst cases,
# we usually focus on the worst case because:
# - It guarantees performance in all situations.
# - Best case is rare and unreliable.
# - Average case depends on probability and is hard to calculate.

# 📌 INTERVIEW SUMMARY (ONE-LINERS)
# ------------------------------------------
# Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
# It repeatedly swaps adjacent elements to sort the array.
# Its time complexity is O(n²) in average and worst cases.
# Its space complexity is O(1) because it sorts in-place.
# We use worst-case complexity to ensure guaranteed performance.
