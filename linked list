# Introduction to Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in separate objects called **nodes**. 
Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

Each node contains:
- **Data** – the value stored in the node
- **Next pointer** – reference to the next node

The first node is called the **head**. 
The last node points to `None`, which indicates the end of the list.

## Why Use Linked List?

- Dynamic size (can grow or shrink)
- Easy insertion and deletion
- Does not require continuous memory

## Limitations

- No direct indexing like arrays
- Extra memory needed for pointers

## Types of Linked List

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
