# Introduction to Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in separate objects called **nodes**. 
Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

Each node contains:
- **Data** – the value stored in the node
- **Next pointer** – reference to the next node

The first node is called the **head**. 
The last node points to `None`, which indicates the end of the list.

## Why Use Linked List?

- Dynamic size (can grow or shrink)
- Easy insertion and deletion
- Does not require continuous memory

## Limitations

- No direct indexing like arrays
- Extra memory needed for pointers

## Types of Linked List

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

# Step 1: Define the Node Structure
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        """Initialize a node with data and a null pointer."""
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

def main():
    # Step 2: Create individual Node instances (Data stage)
    node1 = Node(10)
    node2 = Node(20)
    node3 = Node(30)
    node4 = Node(40)

    # Step 3: Link the nodes (Reference stage)
    # This connects the nodes like a chain
    node1.next = node2
    node2.next = node3
    node3.next = node4

    # Step 4: Traversal
    # We use a 'current' pointer so we don't lose the head (node1)
    print("Traversing the Linked List:")
    current = node1
    while current is not None:
        print(f"{current.data}", end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")

if __name__ == "__main__":    main()
