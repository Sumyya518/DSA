# Selection Sort – DSA

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and places it in its correct position.

## How Selection Sort Works

1. Find the smallest element in the array.
2. Swap it with the first unsorted position.
3. Move the boundary of the sorted part forward.
4. Repeat until the array is sorted.

## Manual Run Example

Initial array:
[7, 12, 9, 11, 3]

Pass 1 → Smallest = 3 → Swap with 7  
[3, 12, 9, 11, 7]

Pass 2 → Smallest = 7 → Swap with 12  
[3, 7, 9, 11, 12]

Pass 3 → Smallest = 9 → Already correct  
[3, 7, 9, 11, 12]

Final sorted array:
[3, 7, 9, 11, 12]

## Algorithm Logic

For an array of n elements:
- Outer loop runs n-1 times.
- Inner loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted part.
- Swap the minimum with the first unsorted element.

## Python Implementation

### `selection_sort.py`

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr

my_array = [7, 12, 9, 11, 3]
print("Sorted array:", selection_sort(my_array))

end!
