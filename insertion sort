# Insertion Sort – DSA

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting each new element into its correct position.

## How Insertion Sort Works

1. Treat the first element as sorted.
2. Pick the next element from the unsorted part.
3. Shift all larger elements one position to the right.
4. Insert the picked element in its correct position.
5. Repeat until the array is sorted.

## Manual Run Example

Initial array:
[7, 12, 9, 11, 3]

Step 1 → [7] is sorted  
Step 2 → Insert 12 → [7, 12]  
Step 3 → Insert 9 → [7, 9, 12]  
Step 4 → Insert 11 → [7, 9, 11, 12]  
Step 5 → Insert 3 → [3, 7, 9, 11, 12]

## Python Implementation

### `insertion_sort.py`

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        current = arr[i]
        j = i - 1

        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > current:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1

        arr[j + 1] = current

    return arr


my_array = [7, 12, 9, 11, 3]
print("Sorted array:", insertion_sort(my_array))

end!
